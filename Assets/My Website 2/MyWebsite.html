    <p>I am Wahldu Burggraaff. I like doing activities that get your adrenaline rushing and I have a big love for watersports. I also like coding and I like to test what I am capable of on a computer. 
        I was born and raised in South Africa, the mother city we all love. I want to study engineering, specifically civil, mechanical or mechatronic because it has been something that I have loved from
         a very young age. I would also like to go in an IT direction because there will always be a job oppertunity in the IT industry and it facinates me. I believe that you get what you give and the 
        more you put in, the more you will recieve at the end of the day. </p>
